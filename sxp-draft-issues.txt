1. RESERVED word in byte diagrams is very confusing, e.g.:

>    Compact TLV
>     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
>     | | | | | | | | | | |1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|3|3|
>     |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|
>     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
>     |O|N|P|C|E| | | |  Type         |  TLV Length   |Reserved       |
>     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------------+-------------------------------+
>     |    Value (Variable: TLV Length octets long)                   |
>     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   this diagram indicates that the common header has 4 bytes (1b flags, 1b type,
   1b length, 1b reserver), while in reality, only 3 bytes are transmitted in
   header (plus value).

2. Missing description of non-compact attribute format

3. Missing description of versions 1&2

4. Missing table which describes which sxp versions support which attributes

5. Missing attribute descriptions - Del-IPv4, Del-IPv6, Add-IPv4, Add-IPv6

6. On page 36, on very top, there are mentioned:
>      |Zero or more global optional attributes which are unrelated  |
>      |to any of the binding delete or add attributes or groups     |
>      |             below them                                      |

   the draft does not explain which attributes are 'global optional'

7. on page 36:

>   If the length of any attribute is larger
>   than the SXP Message length or the sum of Attribute Length of all
>   attributes is larger than the SXP Message length, the Error Sub-code
>   MUST be set to Malformed Attribute List.

    should the sub error code be attribute length error?

8. on page 37:

>   If an optional transitive attribute is unrecognized, the Partial bit
>   (the third high-order bit) in the attribute flags octet is set to 1,
>   and the attribute is retained for export according to the scope in
>   which the attribute appears.

    the draft does not explain which attributes are 'optional transitive'

9. on page 37:

>   A global attribute is exported along
>   every binding specified in this UPDATE message on all connections for
>   which the local peer is a speaker.

    the draft does not explain which attributes are 'global'

10. on page 37:

>   A path attribute is exported
>   along the bindings from a single path.  A per <path, source-group>
>   attribute is exported along bindings received from a single path
>   which share a single Source-Group-Tag attribute.

    the draft does not explain which attributes are 'path'
    the draft does not explain what a 'source-group' is

11. on page 38:

>  5.  Processing trailing optional non-transitive attributes

   the draft does not explain which attributes are
   'trailing optional non-transitive'

12. SXP ERROR message: in chapter 4.6 the draft says that the SXP ERROR message
    has either legacy or extended error format, but there is no information
    on how to choose which format to use when sending the error message. Is
    this free to decide or SXP version dependent?

13. on page 44:

      *  Upon the timer expiry, SXP MUST send an ERROR message with Hold
               Timer Expired code and tear down the connection.

   but there is no such error code described anywhere
