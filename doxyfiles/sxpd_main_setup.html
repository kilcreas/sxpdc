<p>This is the module responsible for starting the daemon. It parses command line parameters, creates event manager instance and config manager instance and passes these to the sxpd setup call. Once SXPD instance is created, it enters the event manager loop to run the instance. This separation allows one to implement more than one SXPD instance in one daemon, should it be necessary (for example to support multiple VRFs).</p>
