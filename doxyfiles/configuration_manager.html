<p>Configuration manager is platform dependent module which handles configuration changes. The goal is to have an API, which would allow easy integration with CLI. This is achieved by making the API asynchronous. SXP daemon provides callbacks to the configuration manager at initialization phase and then just listens for callbacks with new/changed/deleted configuration. Configuration manager watches for configuration changes (platform dependend - it might be a configuration file, the configuration could come from a CLI, from network, etc..) and notifies SXPD via callbacks.</p>
