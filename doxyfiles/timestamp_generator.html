<p>This API is used by SXP daemon to collect timestamps, which are used to keep track of when a specific binding was received. The API also provides a function to compare two timestamps and function for extracting the value for debugging/tracing purposes. The precision of the timestamps is platform dependent and SXP daemon treats them as opaque, only using the API to compare one timestamp to another.</p>
